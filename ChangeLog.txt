1.1.0 (unreleased)
------
- Build with LTO
- Remove tiny-hderive dependency
- Be paranoid and xor together a couple different random generators instead of just using one. Likely an unnecessarily paranoid step but can't hurt either.

1.0.1
------
- Fix an issue where seeds that would generate private keys with trailing zeroes generate the wrong private keys, see https://gitlab.com/standard-mining/wallet-gen/-/issues/1
  This was a bug in a dependency and we fixed it by moving to a different dependency library.
